Craps Basics:
Playing craps in Vegas is an exciting, fast-paced, action-packed game utilizing a pair of dice. Are you wondering how to play craps at a casino? Here are some basics to get you started at a Vegas craps table or craps slot machines.

Craps Rules:
One player, known as the “shooter,” throws the dice at the craps table. All wagers must be placed before the shooter throws the dice. The types of wagers that can be made are:

Craps Terms:
Pass Line-
An even money bet, made on the first roll of the dice (known as the “come out roll”). You win if a 7 or 11 roll, or lose if 2, 3, or 12 roll (known as “craps”). Any other number that rolls becomes the “point” and the point must roll again before a 7 to win.

Don't Pass Line-
An even money bet, which is the opposite of the pass line. You lose on the “come out” roll if the shooter rolls a 7 or 11. You win on a 2 or 3 (12 is a tie). Once a point is established, you lose if the point is thrown and win if a 7 rolls.

Come Bets-
Made anytime after the first roll when a shooter has a point to make. You win on a 7 or 11 and lose on a 2, 3 or 12. Any other number becomes your “come point” and must be repeated for you to win before a 7 rolls.

Don't Come Bets-
Made anytime after the first roll when a shooter has a point to make. It is the opposite of the come bet. You win if 2 or 3 roll (12 is a tie), and lose if 7 or 11 roll. Any other number rolled becomes your “come point” and if repeated you lose. If a 7 rolls you win

Odds-
Once a point is made on the first roll or a come point on a succeeding roll, you may take the odds and win if the point or come points are made before a 7. Payoffs are: 2 to 1 on 4 and 10, 3 to 2 for 5 and 9, 6 to 5 on 6 and 8. “Don’t pass” or “don’t come” bets are in reverse: you must lay the odds in order to win.

Place Bets-
Once a shooter makes a point, you may make a “place bet” on numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. If the shooter rolls any of these numbers before a 7, you win the following payoffs: 9 to 5 on 4 and 10, 7 to 5 on 5 and 9, and 7 to 6 on 6 and 8.

A “place bet” may be taken off anytime before the next roll.

Field Bets-
A one roll bet. You win even money on 3, 4, 9, 10 and 11. You win 2 to 1 on 2. You win 3 to 1 on 12. You lose on 5, 6, 7 or 8.
